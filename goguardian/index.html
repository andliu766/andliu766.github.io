        How to beat goguardian
    </h1>
    
    <body>
        Open up the following link in your browser: chrome://extensions/?id=haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh 
        Alternatively, you can go on the extensions settings page, and click the “Details” button for GoGuardian. 
        Make sure you can see the “Allow access to file URLs” button.
<br>
        Several options here:
            1. Copy and paste the content <a href = "https://andliu766.github.io/goguardian/exthang3r.txt"> here </a> your browser, and follow the instructions. This usually takes about a minute to work.
            <br>
            2. Go to https://dextensify.pages.dev/main, or download the code at https://github.com/ading2210/dextensify/blob/master/main.html to your google drive and open it. Follow the instructions. This is laggier than option 1.
            <br>
            Open a new bookmark folder. Inside it, paste the following link about 800 times: chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/manifest.json Right-click the folder, and open all the tabs in a new window. Immediately after the tabs load, switch back to your original window and hit the “Allow access to file URLs” a few times.
<br>
Glhf, and don’t get caught.
